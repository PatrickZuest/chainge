Preserving nature and limiting human impact on the environment belong to the most important global challenges of today. However, the planet can not be saved in one day: Environmental campaigns oftentimes fail not due to limited funds, but because short-term rewards are limited and because it is hard to measure the impact. Using blockchain technology, we propose a system that incentives citizens to not only preserve the environment they live in, but to actively participate as data gatherers and support individual campaigns. Donations are processed in a complete decentralized way and donors therefore have complete transparency of where their money is going. Additionally, they are reimbursed, in case their donations do not have the desired impact.

This is a project submission for the 2019 BETH "Blockchain School for Sustainability" hackathon. It was built for the "Wild AI" challenge by WWF and uses the Ethereum network. The current version is a functional (but admittedly hacky) prototype that runs on the XXX testnet.

The following students from ETH Zurich contributed to the project: Nico Hauser, David Rode, David Schmid, Ben Spöttling, Patrick Züst.

# Features

## Donor

- Campaign details and goals are displayed on a web interface.

- Donors can make donations to a Campaign with an Ether transaction to the Smart Contract. 

- The Smart Contract automatically redirects the split for the primary WWF project to a predefined address.

- If the campaign goals are not met, the remaining amount will be reimbursed to the donors.

### Further development

- Donors could be allowed to customize the split, this feature is not implemented because this would allow an unbalanced distribution.

  

## Community 

- The local community is incentivized to participate in data-collection and nature-preservation actions by awarding voting tokens for every successful action.
- Blockchain technology is keeping track of every action and awarded token. Fraud and shadow economy are effectively prevented.
- With an easy to use user interface, active community members can influence the wellbeing of their society by voting for different community projects.
- The Smart Contract automatically transfers the funds to the community projects proportionally to their voting count.
