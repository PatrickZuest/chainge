Preserving nature and limiting human impact on the environment belong to the most important global challenges of today. However, the planet can not be saved in one day: Environmental campaigns oftentimes fail not due to limited funds, but because short-term rewards are limited and because it is hard to measure the impact. Using blockchain technology, we propose a system that incentives citizens to not only preserve the environment they live in, but to actively participate as data gatherers and support individual campaigns. Donations are processed in a complete decentralized way and donors therefore have complete transparency of where their money is going. Additionally, they are reimbursed, in case their donations do not have the desired impact.

This is a project submission for the 2019 BETH "Blockchain School for Sustainability" hackathon. It was built for the "Wild AI" challenge by WWF and uses the Ethereum network. The current version is a functional (but admittedly hacky) prototype that runs on the XXX testnet.

The following students from ETH Zurich contributed to the project: Nico Hauser, David Rode, David Schmid, Ben Spöttling, Patrick Züst.

# Features

## Donors

- Information about a campaign and specific impact goals are displayed on the website. Those details are stored in a blockchain and it is hence impossible to change them retrospectively.

- Donors can make an Ether donation to the Campaign, if they are convinced of the specific parameters and impact goals. The funds are then stored in a decentralized smart contract and can therefore only be used for their intended purpose. This can easily be verified by donors as well as regulators - there is no need to trust a middleman.

- A previously defined split of the donations is automatically sent to the initiator of the campaign. It is however not possible to claim any other donations.

- In case the campaign goals are not met, the remaining funds are reimbursed automatically to the donors. This is a reassurance for them, but also an incentive for the citizens and the project initiator.

### Further development

- Donors could be allowed to explicitly state, how much of their money should go towards the environmental campaign and how much towards the community project. 

- With the data gathered during a campaign, it is possible to automatically generate regular updates for donors.
  

## Community 

- The local community is incentivized to participate in data-collection and nature-preservation actions by awarding voting tokens for every successful action.
- Blockchain technology is keeping track of every action and awarded token. Fraud and shadow economy are effectively prevented.
- With an easy to use user interface, active community members can influence the wellbeing of their society by voting for different community projects.
- The Smart Contract automatically transfers the funds to the community projects proportionally to their voting count.
