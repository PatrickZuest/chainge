# Features

## Donor

- Campaign details and goals are displayed on a web interface.

- Donors can make donations to a Campaign with an Ether transaction to the Smart Contract. 

- The Smart Contract automatically redirects the split for the primary WWF project to a predefined address.

- If the campaign goals are not met, the remaining amount will be reimbursed to the donors.

### Further development

- Donors could be allowed to customize the split, this feature is not implemented because this would allow an unbalanced distribution.
