# Features

## Donor

- Campaign details and goals are displayed on a web interface.

- Donors can make donations to a Campaign with an Ether transaction to the Smart Contract. 

- The Smart Contract automatically redirects the split for the primary WWF project to a predefined address.

- If the campaign goals are not met, the remaining amount will be reimbursed to the donors.

### Further development

- Donors could be allowed to customize the split, this feature is not implemented because this would allow an unbalanced distribution.

  

## Community 

- The local community is incentivized to participate in data-collection and nature-preservation actions by awarding voting tokens for every successful action.
- Blockchain technology is keeping track of every action and awarded token. Fraud and shadow economy are effectively prevented.
- With an easy to use user interface, active community members can influence the wellbeing of their society by voting for different community projects.
- The Smart Contract automatically transfers the funds to the community projects proportionally to their voting count.
